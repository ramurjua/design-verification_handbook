<h1 id="uvm">UVM</h1>
<p>UVM is a framework of SystemVerilog classes from which fully
functional testbenches can be built. The methodology specifies and lays
out a set of guidlines to be followed for creation od verification
testbenches. UVM provides a set of base classes from which more complex
classes can be build by inheritance and adding into it certain functions
required for verification enviroment.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure uniformity between different verification teams.</li>
<li>Flexibility.</li>
<li>Ease of mantaining testbenches.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example:</em> The sequence-driver hanshake mechanishm is taken
care of under the hood so that only stimulus need to be written. This
saves quite a lot of time in setting up a testbench stucture since the
foundation itself is well defined.</p>

<h2 id="components-vs-objects">Components vs Objects</h2>
<p>Every simulation testbench has a few key components like: drivers,
monitors, stimulus generators and scoreboards. UVM provides a base-class
for each component, with standarize functions to instantiate, connect
and build the testbench enviroment. These are static entities called
components, that exist throughout a simumlation. These components
operate and process on some kind of data that flows around the
environment. The data or transactions are called objects or sequence
items the appear and disappear at varios times in the simulation and is
more dynamic in nature.</p>
<p><em>uvm_object</em> is the main class, it defines methods for common
operations like copy, compare and print. Typically it is used to build
testbench and testcase configurations.</p>
<p>There are two branches in hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>uvm_component</em>: classes that define verification components:
<em>uvm_driver, uvm_monitor, uvm_sequencer_ uvm_agent, uvm_test,
uvm_env, uvm_scoreboard</em>.</li>
<li><em>uvm_transaction</em>: classes that define data objects consumed
and operated upong by verification components: <em>uvm_sequence_item,
uvm_sequence_base, uvm_sequence</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>uvm_sequence</em> is a container for the actual stimulus to the
design. If you put different stimuyli into differents sequences, it
enhances the ability to reuse and drive thsese sequences in random order
to get more coverage and verifiacation results.</li>
<li><em>uvm_sequence_item</em> is a data object that have to be driven
to DUT are generally called as sequence items.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>uvm_driver</em>: drive signals to DUT</li>
<li><em>uvm_monitor</em>: monitor signals at DUT output port</li>
<li><em>uvm_sequencer</em>: create different tests patterns</li>
<li><em>uvm_agent</em>: contains the sequencer, driver and monitor</li>
<li><em>uvm_env</em>: contains all other verification components</li>
<li><em>uvm_scoreboard</em>: checker that determines if test
passed/failed</li>
<li><em>uvm_subscriber</em>: subscribes to activites of other
components</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="phases">Phases</h2>
<p>A main feature that components inherit from their parents class
<em>uvm_component</em> is Phasing. Each component hoes thorugh a
pre-defined set of phases, and it cannot proceed to the neext phase
until all components finish their execution in the current phase. So UVM
phases act as a synchronizyng mechanism in the life cycle of a
simulation.</p>
<p>Methods that do not consume simulation time are functions and methods
that consume simulation time are tasks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Build time phases:
<ul>
<li><em>build_phase</em> (function): used to buiild testbench compoents
and create their instances.</li>
<li><em>connect_phase</em> (function): used to connect between different
testbench components.</li>
<li><em>end_of_elaboration_phase</em> (function): other functions
requerid to be done after conection.</li>
<li>start_of_simulation_phase (function): used to set initial run-time
configuration or display</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run time phases:
<ul>
<li><em>run_phase</em> (task): actual simulation that consumes time,
runs parallel to other UVM run-time phases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clean-up phases:
<ul>
<li><em>extract_phase</em> (function): used to extract and compute
expected data from scoreboard.</li>
<li><em>check_phases</em> (function): used to perform scoreboard tasks
that check for errors between expected an actual values.</li>
<li><em>report_phase</em> (function): used to display results from
checkers, summary, and other test objectives</li>
<li><em>final_phase</em> (function): typically used to do last minute
operations before exiting simulation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why SystemVerilog testbench need phases and verilog testbench
does not?</strong></p>
<p>Verilog testbenches have all its components made of static containers
or modules. Since a module is static, all modules will be created at
beginning of the simulation and don’t have to worry about any components
getting called without being created or initialized. SystemVerilog
introduces OOP features. This enables the creation of well structured
entites that can be rused and desployed when required. These class
objects can be created in the middle of the simulation. What means is
that testbench components can be created at different times, and hance
you could end up calling a copmponent while it hasn’t been initialized
yet leading to woring testbench outputs.</p>
