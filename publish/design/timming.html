<h1 id="timming-analysis">Timming Analysis</h1>
<p>In digital designs each and every flip-flop has some restrictions
related to the data with respect to the clock. There is always a region
around the clock edge in which input data should not change at the
input. If the data changes within this window, we cannot guarantee the
output. The output can be the result of either of the previous input,
the new input or metastability. This window is marked by the setup time
and the hold time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup time: is defined as the minimum amount of time required to for
the input to a FF to be stable before a clock edge.</li>
<li>Hold time: is defined as the minimum amount of time required for the
input to a FF to be stable after a clock edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigating setup violation: 1. Decreasing clk-&gt;q delay of
launching flop 2. Decreasing the propagation delay of the combinational
cloud 3. Reducing the setup time requirement of capturing flop 4.
Increasing the skew between capture and launch clocks 5. Increasing the
clock period</p>
<p>Mitigating hold violation: We can meet the hold requirement by: 1.
Increasing the clk-&gt;q delay of launching flop 2. Decreasing the hold
requirement of capturing flop 3. Decreasing clock skew between capturing
clock and launching flip-flops</p>
<h3 id="how-does-setup-and-hold-time-relate-to-clock-frequency">How does
setup and hold time relate to clock frequency?</h3>
<p>The maximum clock frequency is the mimum clock period (T), and the
minimum period allowed for a circuit is equal to the addition of setup
time (tsu), propagation time (tp) and hold time (th). The propagation
delay is the amount of time it takes for signals to pass between two
Flip-Flops.</p>
<p>fmax = 1.0 / (tsu + tp + th)</p>
<h3 id="what-is-metastability">What is metastability?</h3>
<p>Metastability is a phenomenon of unstable equilibrium in digital
electronics in which the sequential element is not able to resolve the
state of the input signal; hence, the output goes into unresolved state
for an unbounded interval of time.</p>
<p>The flop starts to capture the data and output also starts to
transition. But, before output has changed its state, the input is
cut-off from the output as clock edge has arrived. The output is, then,
left hanging between state ‘0’ and state ‘1’. Theoretically, the output
may remain in this state for an indefinite period of time. But, given
the time to settle down, the output will eventually settle to either its
previous state or the new state. Thus, the effect of signal present at
input of flop may not travel to the output of the flop partly or
completely. The metastability failure is said to have occurred if the
output has not resolved itself by the time it must be available for
use.</p>
<h2 id="synchronizers">Synchronizers</h2>
<p>Asynchronous signals cause catastrophic metastability failures when
introduced into a clock domain. So, the first thing that arises is to
find ways to avoid metastability failures. But the fact is that
metastability cannot be avoided. A synchronizer is a digital circuit
that converts an asynchronous signal from a different clock domain into
the recipient clock domain so that it can be captured without
introducing any metastability failure. However, the introduction of
synchronizers does not totally guarantee prevention of metastability. It
only reduces the chances of metastability by a huge factor. Thus, a good
synchronizer must be reliable with high MTBF, should have low latency
from source to destination domain and should have low area/power
impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two flip-flop synchronizer</li>
<li>Handshacking based synchronizer</li>
<li>Mux based synchronizer</li>
<li>Two clock FIFO synchronizer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-flip-flop-synchronizer">Two flip-flop synchronizer</h3>
<p>This is the most simple and most common synchronization scheme and
consists of two or more flip-flops in chain working on the destination
clock domain. This approach allows for an entire clock period for the
first flop to resolve metastability.</p>
<p>The two flop synchronizer must be used to synchronize a single bit
data only. Using multiple two flops synchronizers to synchronize
multi-bit data may lead to catastrophic results as some bits might pass
through in first cycle; others in second cycle. Thus, the destination
domain FSM may go in some undesired state.</p>
<p>MTBF decreases almost linearly with the number of synchronizers in
the system. Thus, if your system uses 1000 synchronizers, each of these
must be designed with at least 1000 times more MTBF than the actual
reliability target.</p>
<h3 id="handshacking-based-synchronizer">Handshacking based
synchronizer</h3>
<p>Two flop synchronizer works only when there is one bit of data
transfer between the two clock domains and the result of using multiple
two-flop synchronizers to synchronize multi-bit data is
catastrophic.</p>
<p>The solution for this is to implement handshaking based
synchronization where the transfer of data is controlled by handshaking
protocol where in source domain places data on the REQ signal. When it
goes high, receiver knows data is stable on bus and it is safe to sample
the data. After sampling, the receiver asserts ACK signal. This signal
is synchronized to the source domain and informs the sender that data
has been sampled successfully and it may send a new data.</p>
<p>Handshaking based synchronizers offer a good reliable communication
but reduce data transmission bandwidth as it takes many cycles to
exchange handshaking signals. Handshaking allows digital circuits to
effectively communicate with each other when response time of one or
both circuits is unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="mux-based-synchronizer">Mux based synchronizer</h3>
<p>It is suitable for more than 1-bit widht. The working is that the
source domain sends an enable signal indicating that it the data has
been changed. This enable is synchronized to the destination domain
using the two flop synchronizer. This synchronized signal acts as an
enable signal indicating that the data on data bus from source is stable
and destination domain may latch the data. The two flop synchronizer
acts as a sub-unit of mux based synchronization scheme.</p>
<h3 id="two-clock-fifo-synchronizer">Two clock FIFO synchronizer</h3>
<p>It is a ‘cyclic buffer’ (dual port RAM) that is written into by the
data coming from the source domain and read by the destination
domain.</p>
<p>There are two pointers maintained; one corresponding to write, other
pointing to read. These pointers are used by these two domains to
conclude whether the FIFO is empty or full. For doing this, the two
pointers (from different clock domains) must be compared. Thus, write
pointer has to be synchronized to receive clock and vice-versa. Thus, it
is not data, but pointers that are synchronized.</p>
