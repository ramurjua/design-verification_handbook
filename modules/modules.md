# Code Modules

This section contains digital design modules that have been successfully developed, verified, and tested. The goal is to build a reusable library that can be easily integrated into future personal or professional projects.

### ðŸ”¹ UART Transmitter & Receiver

[UART Transmitter & Receiver](uart/uart.md) sequential modules to transmit and receive data serially using the UART protocol.

### ðŸ”¹ SPI Master & Slave

[SPI Master & Slave](spi/spi.md) modules to implement a master and slave spi agents.

### ðŸ”¹ Clark Park Direct & Inverse & DDS

[Clark Park Direct & Inverse & DDS](clarkpark/clarkpark.md) modules that performs the clark-park transformations in amplitud invariant mode and clark-park inverse transformations. There is also a module to generate sin and cos waveforms of selected frequency.
